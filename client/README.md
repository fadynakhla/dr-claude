Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Notes

This project was developed during the Anthropic hackathon. You can find the project at [this link](https://partiful.com/e/WLszTLRL4ftfhEqBtKGD).

**Potential Improvements:**

- Implement auto-scrolling for all chat messages to enhance user experience.
- Consider changing the project image for a more appealing look.
- Display the name of the patient within the chat interface for better context.
- Make the CSS of the conversation more dynamic to ensure it's responsive on various screen sizes.
- Explore deployment options on platforms like AWS, Heroku, Vercel, etc., for wider accessibility.
- Little bit more clean up

## Resources

Here are the resources that I utilized during the hackathon:

- Generated the project image using the Bing AI Image Creation Tool.
- Followed the [React Chat Tutorial](https://getstream.io/chat/react-chat/tutorial/) to build the chat functionality.
- For building a chat app with real-time capabilities, I referred to the guide on [Building a Chat App with Socket.io and React](https://dev.to/novu/building-a-chat-app-with-socketio-and-react-2edj).
- Also found helpful insights from various video resources.
